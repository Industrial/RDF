Basic tools for Node.js for working with RDF.

Eventually I want to implement a SPARQL endpoint for Levelgraph.

### Levelgraph server
LevelDB is a fast database. It's extensibility and speed are great features.
Levelgraph is an implementation of a triple store. It has a streaming API
aswell so the IO throughput could be great!


### Raptor RDF library
Raptor is a library that can convert a lot of formats.

  grddl             atom
  guess             json
  json              json-triples
  ntriples          nquads
  rdfa          to  ntriples
  rdfxml            rdfxml
  rss-tag-soup      rdfxml-abbrev
  trig              rdfxml-xmp
  turtle            turtle
                    rss-1.0
                    dot
